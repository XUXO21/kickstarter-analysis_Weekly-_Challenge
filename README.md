For this reason we have been asked to help Louise to undestand how capaigns fared taking in count launch dates and funding goals by using Kickstarter data given to us. This inforation regarding capagns allowed us to know: type and subtype of campaigns, their objetive, how many peolple pledge, the amounts of the actual pledges for the projects and also we have information related to when the capaigns were activated, for how much time and in wich year.

All this on order to give counsil to Louise after her play Fever had good fundraising results in a short amount of time.

### 1.1 Purpose

Purpose of the analysis is that based on the information we have we need to give a recomendation to our client Luise to define her next steps regarding her play. The main objetive is to base on the knowledge we have been generating form previosu classes to undestand data bases, analyse their inforation trough excel tools and learn to come to conlusions and to give recomendations combining, inforation, analysis and comunication skills.

Louise is investing her mony and the money of the people pleadging on her idea so is iportant to be able to give her founded desitions so she can obtain success.

## 2 Analysis and Challenges

Anaylisis was generated trough information obtained by the kickstarter .API that gave us inforation from different kind of capaigns like the type of them, a general description, also we had the parameters for undestanding variables for Geography, to undestand not only the US campaigns were our client had interest but also to try to undestand bencharks in other countries or even to know performance in specific markets to determine possible incursion on them. Also wew had inforamtion regarding their pledge objectives, actuals pledge, number of bakers and finally we counted with date data like the start and end of the capagins.

The fist challenge we see is that information not allways comes ready or in a friandly way to analyze and generate reports. For example the date was in a non readable format, and because of that we needed to workaround to determine date in an understadable way.
